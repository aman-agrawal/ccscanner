This is a temporary repository to meet the Anonymous Review Policy. You can start the trial by running "scanner.py". 

Since Gitsubmodule and Buck module need some active tokens, such as GitHub token. We comment these modules in this anonymous version. You can still read the code.

Centris is available at: https://github.com/WOOSEUNGHOON/Centris-public.
